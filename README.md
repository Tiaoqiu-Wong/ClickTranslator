# Project1_real_time_translator
This is a simple translator which can translate Japanese to simplified Chinese by clicking the button on the top of the interface. You can change the target language or origin language by editing the Python file with notes. This project is based on Python. Baidu AI platform and Baidu Translation platform are used.  You need to own a Baidu account and register both 2 of the platforms mentioned above and have their authorized userid and key respectively before using the program. After getting the userid and key, please fill them in the blanks of the Python file.The original author would not offer userid and key.  Due to the restriction of Baidu Translation  and inner problems, this program's efficiency is not very high. If you see this project accidentally and have interest in improving this program(including giving a better GUI, optimizing the codes, etc.), please do it and email me.
